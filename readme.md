### Oculus

Captures the output of multiple performance commands. Compresses the results. Rolls logs over every 14 days.

List of Commands:
- who
- last
- ip a
- ping -c 8.8.8.8
- arp
- netstat
- lsblk
- cat /proc/meminfo
- free -h
- nvidia-smi
- zpool status
```bash
Ex: bash oculus.bash -r [/path/to/dir] -R [Rollover Days] --ZFS --NVIDIA
```

### Freezer

Backs up and compresses the persistent data used by the Docker containers. Will require a brief outage to complete the backup.
Script will temporarily STOP/START only the active containers. Ensuring inactive containers are not booted with the active ones. Rolls logs over every 14 days.

### ~~Permission Check~~ 
**Temporaily Deprecated** - *Lack of 'no-cobble' causes unintended modifications of compliant files. This breaks things like rollover that relies on last modified time. Script is not recommended to be ran until this is fixed in the next few updates. >2.0.0*

~~Sets the permissions of a directory. By default, chmod == 777 and owner+group == root.
Running the script requires providing a directory path as an argument.~~
```bash
Ex: bash perm_chk.sh [/path/to/dir] [owner] [chmod#]
```
