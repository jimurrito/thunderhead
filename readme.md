### Freezer

Backs up and compresses the persistent data used by the Docker containers. Will require a brief outage to complete the backup.
Script will temporarily STOP/START only the active containers. Ensuring inactive containers are not booted with the active ones. Rolls logs over every 14 days.

### Permission Check

Sets the permissions of a directory. By default, chmod == 777 and owner+group == root.
Running the script requires providing a directory path as an argument.
```bash
Ex: bash prem_check.sh /path/to/dir
```
## Version History

### Version 1.5
+ [+] Added Perm_chk.sh for permissions enforcement.

    (Should have been this from the begining ðŸ˜‰)
